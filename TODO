allocatStrat to reimplement
{
Find a way to make creaton of personal allocstrat easy for the client via maccros maybe something else, what is an issue is really the allocstrat specification

add something in mode debug  for the allocstrat to say that you really allocated or not (like putting a bit to 1 at the end of the ptr adress if allocation have been made)
}

I dont like unique_ptr implem
{
add warnings to cmake

when giving allocated pointer, could check the logged domain and check if it matches with the one typed with unique_ptr

Needs some tests

Try to change non member function pointers for domain (add_elem_domain and remove_elem_domain) and change them with member functions (as core++ 9 video shows)

all uniques (with or without specified domain) works with new on intern, so no more possibility to specify the allocations method, maybe to change
So whether change the new so LIB_NEW can take AllocStrat parameters, whether some unique writing are forbidden 
}

operator new[] gives a pointer alligned while it allocate a header of size 4, trixed malloc call ?


ofstream buffer is allocated with new...

Replace the call to the constructor from Myclass{} to Myclass() for code clarity...

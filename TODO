allocatStrat to reimplement
{
Find a way to make creaton of personal allocstrat easy for the client via maccros maybe something else, what is an issue is really the allocstrat specification

add something in mode debug  for the allocstrat to say that you really allocated or not (like putting a bit to 1 at the end of the ptr adress if allocation have been made)
}

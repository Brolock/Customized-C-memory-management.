GREP TODO!

Add compile flag to desactivate everthing, using template do the trick
reset(ptr) also to do !
reset_new(Args) that do the new in intern, avoiding new please !

Try to change non member function pointers for domain (add_elem_domain and remove_elem_domain) and change them with member functions (as core++ 9 video shows)

Really needs some tests

all uniques (with or without specified domain) works with new on intern, so no more possibility to specify the allocations method, maybe to change
So whether change the new so LIB_NEW can take AllocStrat parameters, whether some unique writing are forbidden 

Find a way to make creaton of personal allocstrat easy for the client via maccros maybe something else, what is an issue is really the allocstrat specification

Replace the call to the constructor from Myclass{} to Myclass() since it can cause issues with the initializer_lists ...

add something in mode debug  for the allocstrat to say that you really allocated or not (like putting a bit to 1 at the end of the ptr adress if allocation have been made)

operator new[] gives a pointer alligned while it allocate a header of size 4, trixed malloc call ?

ofstream buffer is allocated with new...

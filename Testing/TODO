GREP TODO!

reset(ptr) also to do !
reset_new(Args) that do the new in intern, avoiding new please !

Really needs some tests

fusion operator new() impl and nq::allocator.allocate() and nq::New_array impl by one single function that does what we need.

In debug mode header_size and sub_header_size should be equal to 0 since the logic of allocation shouldnt change !

Find a way to make creaton of personal allocstrat easy for the client via maccros maybe something else, what is an issue is really the allocstrat specification

Replace the call to the constructor from Myclass{} to Myclass() since it can cause issues with the initializer_lists ...

add something in mode debug  for the allocstrat to say that you really allocated or not (like putting a bit to 1 at the end of the ptr adress if allocation have been made)

Do something clear with the compile flags

nq::allocator inherite from std::allocator and with a debug flag can just be an empty shell that forward std::allocator

operator new[] gives a pointer alligned while it allocate a header of size 4, trixed malloc call ?

ofstream buffer is allocated with new...

having Domains beeing merged to one single type to avoid too much code size (works with typedef)

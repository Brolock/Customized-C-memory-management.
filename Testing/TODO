Find a way to make creaton of personal allocator easy for the client via maccros maybe something else, what is an issue is really the allocstrat specification

Handle the array new (new[]) and more specifically nq::New[] ? See if it has no downfall on the allocator or things like that

Replace the call to the constructor from Myclass{} to Myclass() since it can cause issues with the initializer_lists ...

add something in mode debug  for the allocstrat to say that you really allocated or not (like putting a bit to 1 at the end of the ptr adress if allocation have been done)

Do something clear with the compile flags

nq::allocator inherite from std::allocator and with a debug flag can just be an empty shell that forward std::allocator

having Domains beeing merged to one single type to avoid too much code size (not urgent)
